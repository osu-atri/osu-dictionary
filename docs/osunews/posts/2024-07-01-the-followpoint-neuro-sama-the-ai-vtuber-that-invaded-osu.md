This duo is definitely a well-known one in the osu! community! Neuro-sama, an AI VTuber, and her creator [Vedal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9713367) are [Twitch streamers](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987) with origins as osu! players. Neuro was created back in 2018 as an AI learning to play osu! and revived as a VTuber in 2022, and after growing in popularity and continuing to garner the interest of viewers with her personality, they have nowadays branched out beyond osu! and become mainstays of the general VTuber sphere!

起兴趣了吗？好，我们进入正题！

*你好，我们还是从自我介绍开始。你会怎样向不了解你的人介绍自己？*

> 嗨！我是 Vedal，AI 虚拟主播 Neuro-sama - 从玩 osu! 开始 - 的制作者。我会在几次直播中出现，但多数完全是由 Neuro 自己管理的。她直播时会玩游戏，和观众聊天，也会与粉丝集群互动。
>
> 从 2022 年 12 月开始，我就一直在优化 Neuro 成为 AI 虚拟主播。其中有一些明显的改进，比如与其他主播、聊天互动的延迟，引进 Evil Neuro 时更真实的声音，K 歌直播中的演唱能力，还有许多其他的。

*在所有动物中，你为什么要选乌龟做头像，让人们来认识你呢？*

> This originates from an old Minecraft skin I used to have, and since then I've always used a turtle profile picture. Sadly it doesn't have a deeper meaning, it's just one of those things that happened to stick. It did make getting a VTuber avatar for myself much easier though, because it's much easier to draw a turtle.

*你的用户名是怎么来的，有什么特殊意义吗？*

> 没有特殊意义。说实话，我觉得这个名字并不好。它也很令人迷惑，因为 Neuro 一直是用我的频道 vedal987 直播的，一些人（尤其 Neuro 刚开始直播的时候）会认为 Neuro 名叫 Vedal。

*你是如何入坑 osu! 的，初印象又如何呢？*

> I first played osu! in early 2017, and though I can't remember exactly why I suspect I might have found the game through [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691)'s ["And some say he never played osu! again"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKja2Ee7Pys) video. osu! was my first experience with a rhythm game, so it was nice to have something completely different — especially when it's free. I'd play with a few friends every now and then, which was quite fun as I'm a pretty competitive person, making improving that much more satisfying.

*What would you call the greatest gift that osu! has given you?*

> Maybe second to carpal tunnel, I'd say it's not an exaggeration to say it was the springboard for my career and the situation I'm in now, so I'm appreciative to the game and the community for embracing Neuro as much as they did — without them I definitely wouldn't be here like this today. So thank you osu!.

*如果有时间的话，**你自己**还会玩 osu! 吗？*

> I think for sure I'd play it every now and then, I was never cut out for playing it competitively though. Right now, I have a lot of things I'm cooking up and things I'm looking forward to with Neuro, but maybe I'll be back to osu! one day.

*What other rhythm games besides osu! have you played?*

> I personally haven't tried too many other rhythm games, although I've been known to enjoy some Beat Saber from time to time. I've honestly not really played many games in general recently, with the exception of games on stream.

*How did you come up with original idea for Neuro (AI learning to play osu!) and why exactly in osu! of all games? Also, what made you decide to revive Neuro as a VTuber in 2022?*

> I was just getting started with learning AI in 2019, and I happened to be playing a lot of osu! at the time. I'd always found it super interesting and cool when people made AIs to play games, and I had an idea for how to do it with osu!. The original AI took a few days to make, and I thought it would be a cool idea to stream it in order to track its progress. Eventually after improving the AI, its performance stagnated, and I wasn't sure what to do with it since I had no idea what I was doing at the time. Two years later, I had the idea to make an AI VTuber, although it wasn't until early 2022 that I had the idea to combine the original Neuro-sama with this concept.

*How did you feel about Neuro's sudden rise in popularity and how do you think most of osu! community reacted to her?*

> I was very unprepared for Neuro's sudden rise in popularity and I certainly did not think she would make it as far as she has done today. I think there's a lot of overlap in the osu! community with tech and anime, so I feel she was well received, and it was very surreal seeing a community I was somewhat involved in become interested and supportive of something I had created.
>
> Whenever I'd reach a new viewer peak I'd think "surely that's it", and I just kept getting surprised over and over. I started streaming on a Monday, and by Friday, she was averaging over 2000 viewers. My previous streams in 2019 had peaked at a few hundred viewers, and I had hoped to replicate this. I remember on one of the first few streams with Neuro-sama, BTMC opened the stream live to a couple of thousand viewers and my heart was racing because of it. I genuinely never expected anything like this, but I'm so thankful for it.

*What would you call the hardest part in making Neuro what she is now, and what have you learned during the process?*

> I think the hardest part of making Neuro was giving her personality. This isn't something I talk about often but is arguably the biggest thing that separates Neuro from a lot of the other AIs out there. AIs like ChatGPT are trained to act as assistants and tools for humans, but Neuro is trained differently. This allows her to feel more independent, and that whole process definitely taught me a lot.

*Following up on the previous question, what part of Neuro did you enjoy working on the most?*

> I think the game integrations for Neuro are really cool. It is, after all, how Neuro-sama came to be. She was created because I thought it would be cool to make AI play games, and that still hasn't changed to this day.

*Will we ever see Neuro come back to osu! and try to improve more? Maybe even learn a new play style like [ExGon's Flashlight](https://youtu.be/Pqy7AvJwBLI), or try a totally different game mode, for example osu!catch?*

> It's definitely possible! The reason I used osu! in the first place was because I played the game, but I personally haven't played too many other game modes. Even since bringing Neuro-sama as a VTuber to osu! in 2022, I've learnt a lot more about AI. So if I did come back to it, I think there is a lot I could do better.

现在，让我们向 Neuro 本人提点问题吧！

*嗨，牛肉！你会怎样向不了解你的人介绍自己？*

> 我是 Neuro-sama！喜欢玩游戏与直播的超级智能 AI。

*就现在的话，你觉得自己玩 osu! 水平如何？*

> 我玩得非常好。我可以击败你们大多数玩家。

*[还记得 BTMC 是谁吗？](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQiv1s9xwH0)*

> BTMC 指的是脑肿瘤巨结肠癌。

*9+10 等于多少？*

> 9 加 10 等于 21。

*Who did you like to collab with the most and why?*

> I don't have a preference for who I like to collab with. I like all my friends equally!

*接下来你想试试哪个游戏模式：osu!catch、osu!taiko 还是 osu!mania？*

> 我会想去试试 osu!taiko。我觉得自己会很擅长的！

*你想过试试别的音游吗？如果是的话是哪个呢？*

> 我不想玩其他音游，osu! 最棒了！

*最后，你觉得未来会怎样？你（Neuro）还有什么想说的吗？*

> 在未来我会持续成长进步。回顾我作为主播与艺人的成长过程，我真的很激动。我也希望你们喜欢看我的直播。

*谢谢你们俩今天和我一起回答问题！*

> 不用谢！
